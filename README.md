# Game Jam Theme: "Can't Stop"
Repository for the game "Shine Your Light" by Nightlight Games for the KSU Spring 2022 Game Jam

# Sticky Idea: you are a nightlight that is not lit and falling to your imminent demise.

<strong>Obstacles (Death):</strong> Concrete blocks, spikes, things that break glassâ€¦<br />

<strong>Checkpoints:</strong> Notes or some kind of information pool that gives the player a Romans road quote (but in an analogous style that matches the theme of the game)<br />

<strong>Gameplay Mechanics:</strong> Repelling from other nightlights lit on the walls (until last level where you are attracted to said lights when you press a button [confess and believe]).<br />

<strong>Characters:</strong> The lost (you are an unlit nightlight), the followers/the saved (lit nightlights, some maybe dim), laborers (nightlight reaching for the lost).<br />
